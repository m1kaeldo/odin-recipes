Basic recipe website project

This is the first project of The Odin Project's foundation course. 
I'm going to build a basic HTML site which consist of a main index
page which have links to a few recipes. 

The main objective of this project is to harden HTML skills and will 
revisit the project again in the future to style it up with some CSS.
