  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 cups chicken broth, or as needed</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 medium shallots, diced</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
    <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>
    <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over
      medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until
      soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set
      aside.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and
      cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil
      and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2
      cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue
      adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is
      absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20
      minutes.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter,
      chives, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve
      immediately.
